# Chaotax

## Ideally a better name, chaoticgym?, others?

How do we define discrete or continuous actions, some discretisation scheme easily?
Would be good to have a generative env
Would be good to work with MARL and SARL
What is the reward schema, is it controlling chaos or else, maybe easily adjustable by having a sep reward func, also good for model-based rl

What envs do we provide:
- Logistic Map
- Tent Map
- Lorenz etc etc
- Predator-Prey
- Van der Pol Oscillator
- KS Equation
- Kuramoto Oscillator
- Other fluidy things
- N-Pendulum (aka like double pendulum and greater)
- Three body problem

Check the PhD thesis to get a summary of all the envs

Would be great to have a render option for all that can be done in eval stages, or perhaps some jittable gif saver?
